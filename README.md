# Draw A Perfect Circle
---
## Description

The game is still being made and thus the ReadMe file is also not finished yet.

The game wants you to draw a perfect circle on the screen of your phone. It will calculate % of its deviation from a perfect circle and present it to you as a score.



Game is based on Apple's drawing engine called "Leveraging Touch Input for Drawing Apps". Rest of the logic is implemented by me.
